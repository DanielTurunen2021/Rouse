# Rouse

My work in the 3rd project "Rouse" made at FutureGames in Stockholm, Sweden in 2021. This was a 7 week project made in Unreal Engine 5 and is our first project made in Unreal Engine. We were a team of 14 people working on the project:

I worked on a number of things during the project:

*I worked on the ammo system and its implementation(shooting, ammo replenishment and switching of ammo types)
* I made a simple respawner for the player(which later got extended to also respawn other things)
* I implemented (limited) controller support. Unfortunately the controller does not work in the in game menus.
* I did much of the audio implementation for the projectiles, interactable cubes, walking sounds on different surfaces(using animation notifies and the animation BPs and different physics materials for each surface) 
  and simple music implementation for each level.
* I set up a collision sphere for the eyes in the beginning of one of the levels to turn on visibility for each eye individually instead of all of them at the same time.
* I helped clean up grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the story script and tutorials
